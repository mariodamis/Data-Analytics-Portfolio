# Data Analyst Portfolio

Hi, I'm Mario Damis👋

I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Information Security and Intelligence, with advanced studies in Business Intelligence. I have a strong passion for working with data and uncovering meaningful insights that support smarter decision-making.

My academic journey has equipped me with a blend of technical, analytical, and security-focused skills, allowing me to not only extract and visualize data but also understand the importance of protecting its integrity and confidentiality. Through my studies and hands-on projects, I’ve become proficient in tools such as Python, SQL, Tableau, Power BI, and Excel.

🔍 I enjoy:
- Transforming raw data into actionable insights  
- Designing dashboards and visualizations  
- Exploring trends and patterns that tell compelling stories  
- Continuously learning and expanding my skills in data analysis and intelligence

Whether I’m collaborating with a team or working independently, I am driven by curiosity and the impact data can have on solving real-world problems.
